\chapter{The Hall~C Spectrometers}

%\section{Introduction}

	The two magnetic spectrometers in Hall~C are the principal instruments
available for use in electron scattering experiments. In the following three
Sections we discuss the safe operation of these two spectrometers,
the High Momentum Spectrometer, or HMS,
and the Short Orbit Spectrometer, or SOS. The spectrometers are
discussed as a series of subsystems.

Both spectrometers are composed of a magnet system, consisting of both
quadrupole and dipole magnets. The HMS has a triplet of superconducting
quadrupoles, while the SOS has only one resistive quadrupole magnet.
The primary purpose of the quadrupole magnets is to increase the flux of
charged particles entering the dipole magnet and to focus the orbits of the
charged particles into the detector plane.
The HMS has one superconducting dipole magnet following the quadrupole triplet,
and the SOS has two resistive dipole magnets. The primary purpose of these
dipole magnets is to deflect charged particles such that they can be momentum
analyzed.
Each spectrometer has a rotatable support structure, called the
carriage, which supports the magnets.

In addition, there is a separate
structure which contains the particle detector packages the shield house.

The HMS shield house is attached to the carriage via a ``push bar" on the ``pasta
fork".  The ``pasta fork" is the name given to the steel piece that protrudes
from the back of the carriage. The detector frame is supported on the
``pasta fork." This insures that the detectors do not move relative
to the magnetic elements.

The detector package must perform at least two functions, tracking and
particle identification (PID). A particle traversing the detector stack
encounters two sets of drift chambers with six planes of sense
wires in each chamber. From the chamber information both positions
and angles in the dispersive and transverse directions can be determined.
The information from these chambers is the principal input
of the tracking algorithms.

The chambers are followed by two planes of hodoscopes designated S1X and S1Y.
These plastic scintillator arrays provide the timing reference for the
drift chambers, are used in trigger formation, and in combination
with a second hodoscope pair, provide time-of-flight particle identification.
These scintillators can also be used to perform crude tracking.

The next element encountered by a particle is a gas threshold Cerenkov detector.
This is used for particle identification. In the SOS spectrometer, this
gas threshold Cerenkov detector can be replaced by an Aerogel detector,
with a similar function.

The second hodoscope pair, S2X and S2Y, is located directly behind the
gas Cerenkov. Their function is essentially the same as that of S1X and S1Y.
In the SOS spectrometer, an option exists to have this hodoscope pair
be preceded by a third chamber to improve tracking.

The final element in the detector stack is the lead glass shower calorimeter.
This is used for energy determination and PID.
	
To reduce the resolution degrading effects of multiple scattering, the entire
interior of the spectrometer from the pivot to the detector hut is a vacuum
vessel. The ends of this evacuated
volume are capped by relatively thin vacuum windows.

The aforementioned subsystems will be discussed in more detail in the next three
sections. The remainder of this section will describe some features common to
the two spectrometers, then the following major sections will be devoted to the specifics 
of the HMS, and the SOS, respectively.

\subsection{Features Common to Both Spectrometers}

\subsubsection{Vacuum Windows}

\paragraph{Overview}

Because multiple scattering degrades the performance of a spectrometer, it is
important that the spectrometer volume be evacuated and that the vacuum
entrance and exit windows
be as low mass as possible. However,
catastrophic window failure would generate a significant shock wave as air
rushed to fill the vacuum volume. It would also cause a loud noise which
could cause hearing damage to anyone in the immediate vicinity.
The material chosen for the vacuum windows, then, must be both light enough
to have a minimum effect on the beam and
strong enough to operate reliably and safely.

To achieve the above goals,
composite Mylar/Kevlar vacuum windows have been constructed for the
Hall~C spectrometers. The density of the Kevlar used
is $\approx 0.75$ gm/cm$^3$ with a radiation
length of $55.2$ cm \cite{rdup1}. The radiation length
of Mylar is $28.7$ cm. The Kevlar has a tensile strength of 900 lbs/inch.

The HMS spectrometer vacuum can has a volume
of approximately $6$ m$^3$, representing a stored energy of $6 \times 10^5$
Joules. A drawing of the exit flange to which the vacuum
window is attached is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hms_flange}.  It is a
circle with a center-to-center bolt hole diameter of $40$ inches
and a $38$ inch diameter vacuum opening. This is the largest vacuum window
required for Hall~C.
Under vacuum, this window must support 16,785
lbs (74,425 N). It is located in the HMS detector hut. The HMS
entrance window is located near the pivot and has a center-to-center
bolt hole diameter of $10.5$ inches.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{spectrometers/figHMSflange.eps}
\caption{The HMS exit flange and the 8" vacuum spool piece. \label{fig:hms_flange}}
\end{figure}

The SOS spectrometer vacuum can has a volume of approximately $2$ m$^3$,
representing a stored energy of $2 \times 10^5$ Joules. The entrance
window (near the pivot) is round and has a diameter of $9$ inches.
The SOS exit window is the second largest window in Hall~C. This
window is located in the SOS detector hut. It is rectangular.
The opening has a length of $40.5$ inches and a width of $6.5$ inches.
The SOS exit
window must support a load of $3,896$ lbs ($17,275$ N) under vacuum.

{\bf One of the responsible personnel must be present for
any work directly affecting a Hall~C vacuum window}.

\paragraph{Design and Placement of HMS Large Window}

After extensive testing of the above design
and of other similar designs and fabrics (Spectra, Kevlar/Nylon fabric),
we chose to have a new
material custom laminated for our purposes. The new window material is
composed of 0.015 inch ballistic Kevlar 29 style 713 (31x 31 count,
plain weave)
with 0.004 inch Mylar on
one side
and 0.001 inch thick Mylar on the other. Bolt holes are cut into the material
(using a custom made cutting tool) and it is then directly
mounted on a ring flange using standard O-ring vacuum
seal technique.  This material and
method have
been used successfully on both Hall~C spectrometers, holding a vacuum of
$\approx 10^{-4}$ Torr. It is necessary to have a large number of bolt holes in the flange ring
for clamping strength.

Figures~\ref{fig:hms_window} shows the
window and ring flanges as mounted on the spectrometer. The thick
line represents the composite window. There are O-ring grooves on both the
ring flange for the window mount and on the spectrometer exit flange.
The ring flanges are rounded so as not to cut into the window fabric as
it bows under pressure.
For more detail on the window mounting, see
the section entitled ``Vacuum Window Installation Procedure", below.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{spectrometers/figHMSwindow.eps}
\caption{The HMS vacuum window and ring flanges. \label{fig:hms_window}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:hms_window2} shows the window as placed in the HMS spectrometer
detector hut.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{spectrometers/figHMShut.eps}
\caption{The HMS vacuum window in the HMS spectrometer hut. 
\label{fig:hms_window2}}
\end{figure}

The window (in its ring flanges) is mounted at the end of the $8$ inch
vacuum exit extension piece. The next element is an aluminum shutter which
must be lowered to cover the Mylar/Kevlar window whenever it is under
vacuum and personnel are working in the detector hut. The shutter
control panel is just outside the shielding house door, and an
indicator light signals whether the shutter is in or out.  

\paragraph{Other Windows}

The HMS spectrometer vacuum entrance is a $10.5$ inch (bolt circle) round
window. Presently, the entrance window
is made of the same laminate as the exit window. The
procedure for installation (see below) is also the same.
It is
also allowable to employ thinner Kevlar/Mylar
material for the HMS entrance window and for
the SOS spectrometer windows; a similar laminate as used in the
larger windows has been tested and utilized.  The thinner material is
composed of 0.0045'' Kevlar sandwiched between 2 sheets of 0.002'' Mylar.

The SOS spectrometer windows are currently made of the same composite fabric
as the HMS windows. The SOS exit window is rectangular, with a $6.5$ inch
by $39.5$ inch opening.
The window is cut out and installed with an O-ring as with the HMS
windows (see Figure~\ref{fig:hms_window}).
Because the maximum
loads under vacuum on the SOS windows (and HMS entrance window)
are much smaller than that on the HMS exit window,
there is
no aluminum shutter in the SOS spectrometer.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{spectrometers/figSOSwindow.eps}
\caption{The SOS exit window and the vacuum test tank. \label{fig:sos_window}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Window Material Testing}

Standard models used in predicting vacuum
window performance do not predict the actual performance of Kevlar laminate
fabrics accurately \cite{rbrook1,rllnl2}. Therefore, extensive tests of the
Mylar/Kevlar composite windows have been done and more are planned.
A summary of pressure
tests on windows composed of the custom laminated
fabric currently used in construction of all Hall~C vacuum windows is
given in Tables~\ref{tab:win_tst1} and \ref{tab:win_tst2}, below. Both vacuum and hydrostatic test 
tanks
are available for the HMS circular windows and for the SOS rectangular
window. Figure~\ref{fig:sos_window} shows a picture of the SOS vacuum
test tank.  The large round
HMS vacuum test tank uses the $8$ inch vacuum extension piece shown
earlier in Figure~\ref{fig:hms_window} (but removed from the spectrometer) with a $1.5$
inch thick aluminum blanking flange. For hydrostatic testing, windows (both
round and rectangular) are mounted directly on
blanking flanges with appropriate water fittings installed.

\begin{table}
\includegraphics[height=7.5in]{spectrometers/vacuum.ps}
\caption{Tests on the Hall~C Vacuum Windows (1 of 2) \label{tab:win_tst1}} 
\end{table}
\clearpage

\begin{table}
\includegraphics[height=7.5in]{spectrometers/vacuumc.ps}
\caption{Tests on the Hall~C Vacuum Windows (2 of 2) \label{tab:win_tst2}}
\end{table}
\clearpage

The tests show that the large HMS exit window does not begin to leak until
the pressure on it reaches over $3$ atmospheres. The small HMS window
did not begin to leak until over $14$ atmospheres of pressure was applied.
This is consistent with the load being transferred to
the outer circumference, the circumference of the small circle being four
times smaller than that of the large circle. The large rectangular SOS windows
began to leak at around 10 atmospheres. It may be possible to construct thinner
SOS vacuum windows for improved spectrometer resolution if required.

In addition to determining the absolute failure
pressure of the windows, a major goal of the testing effort was to
observe the failure modes of the
window material and flange design. The large windows failed by
ripping around the opening perimeter. The flange ring was then
rounded more and
a better result was obtained. It may be possible to further round the
flange if future tests indicate this to be necessary or advantageous.
The small windows failed by ripping out at the bolt holes.

Another question the tests in Table~\ref{tab:win_tst1} were designed to
answer was if
a biting aluminum clamping O-ring was necessary or advantageous. It was found
that windows with aluminum clamping rings failed at lower pressures than
windows without aluminum rings. The aluminum tended to tear the Mylar, allowing
leaking and uneven stress. The only window which delaminated had water between
the Mylar and Kevlar which leaked in through a tear in the
Mylar caused by the aluminum ring.

In conjunction with outlined full-size window testing, small samples
were subjected to stress and tensile analysis using strain gauge
instrumentation.  Through this work, it was found that the composite
window material maintained the Young's Modules of Kevlar, and had the
same ultinate failure load as Kevlar pieces of the same size.
Further, it was determined that the failure tears were along a
45$^{\circ}$ angle to the woven fibers, consistent with observations
of the rips in the destructively-tested full-size windows.  

In addition to the above testing efforts, two large round HMS exit windows
composed of the custom laminate material were ``knife" tested. The windows
were installed on the vacuum test tank and placed under vacuum. They were then
cut by a blade at the end of a long pole (so as to protect the personnel
testing the window from the results of a catastrophic failure). The window
did not rip any further than the cut and the
material did not delaminate. No evidence for catastrophic failure
was observed in either of these tests.

Although more long term reliability testing is necessary (see below),
results have so far been favorable.
Windows previously used on the HMS spectrometer are routinely hydro
tested to failure after biannual removeable and found to
hold up as well as freshly made windows (see, for example
Table~\ref{tab:win_tst1}).  Windows which have undergone multiple cycles fail at nearly the same pressure as uncycled
windows (see, for example, Table~\ref{tab:win_tst2}). A small round window did not fail after
being left pressurized for
a week at $65$ psi. (this test is not entered in the tables).
Entrance and exit windows composed of the Mylar/Kevlar laminate
material here described have held vacuum on the Hall C
spectrometer effectively and safely for over three years.


\paragraph{Vacuum Window Fabrication and Installation Procedure}

This procedure must be followed for installing any Hall~C spectrometer
vacuum window. One of the responsible personnel must be present during
all steps of fabrication and installation.
Although the procedure below is specifically for
the HMS large window, it is the same for the small HMS and for both SOS windows,
except as noted.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Place window material, thin Mylar side down,
on a large flat, extremely clean, surface (such as
the marble table in EEL 126 after being washed).}

\item{Place window flange ring (also freshly cleaned) on top of material
and trace outer
circle (or rectangle for SOS) and bolt holes with transparency marking
pen.}

\item{Remove flange ring and cut out circle using Kevlar cutting 
shears.}

\item{Cut out bolt holes using appropriate (custom-made) drill press tool.
For the larger windows, this is a two person job as one is needed to hold the
material up so that it can't be nicked by the side of the drill press table
while the other concentrates on cutting the holes.}

\item{Clean the aluminum flange ring thoroughly and wipe with isopropyl
alcohol. For all but the HMS exit window, the flange ring and
window should be brought to the hall.  For the HMS exit window,
continue as outlined below from step 6 on.  For all other windows,
install flange ring and window unit to spectrometer vacuum flange
using standard O-ring vacuum seal practice (i.e. clean all surfaces
thoroughly with alcohol, apply vacuum grease, tighten in star pattern,
etc.)  All bolts should be torqued to 50 ft-lbs (40 ft-lbs for the
SOS exit window).  There must be a correctly tightened bolt in every
bolt hole.  Continue to step 17.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)} Clean Viton O-ring with isopropyl alcohol and apply vacuum
grease as is standard for vacuum connections.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Place Viton ring on HMS vacuum extension piece, composite
window over ring, and aluminum flange (clamping) ring over window.   Bolt together at four corners.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Place and tighten bolts in a star pattern as appropriate for
standard O-ring vacuum seals.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}All bolts should be torqued to 50 ft-lbs (40 ft-lbs for the SOS
exit window).}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Using standard O-ring seal technique, mount other side of
vacuum extension piece on aluminum blanking flange.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Using a transparency marker, trace the flange circle onto the
Mylar/Kevlar window.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Begin vacuum pumping on extension
piece.} 

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Note any creep of traced ring and window
deflection.  Check window for visual abnormalities or imperfections.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Leave under vacuum for at least 1 hour.
Repeat step 13.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Bring vacuum extension piece back to
atmospheric pressure and remove blanking flange.}

\item{{\sl (HMS exit window)}Being extremely careful not to touch the
Mylar/Kevlar window, install extension piece on HMS spectrometer in
hut using standard O-ring vacuum practice.}

\item{Clear detector hut and pivot area for initial pump down. Do not
allow entry for anyone other than the above named personnel to
these areas until a vacuum of at least 50 mTorr is achieved.}

\item{Begin vacuum pumping.}

\item{One of the above named personnel should check and note the
window deflections, recheck bolt torques, and generally look for
irregularities in the window deflections, before allowing
general entry to the detector
hut or pivot areas. That person should wear ear protection at all times while
near windows. Bolts should be retorqued if necessary.}

\item{Place a clearly visible tag near the vacuum window indicating
date of installation, estimated date of removal, and names and phone
numbers of contact personnel.}

\item{Recheck bolt torque, vacuum, and window deflection
again a couple of hours later (again, this should be done by
qualified personnel only, wearing hearing
protection). Retorque bolts if necessary.
If the window deflection has increased more than 3/4 inch, begin the entire
process again with a new window.}

\item{The windows should be changed as close to every 6 months as
reasonable given experiment run scheduling considerations. It is not
necessary to stop a run to change the windows, but they should be changed
as soon as possible thereafter.}

\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{Safety Procedure for Working Near Vacuum Windows}

%Before entering the detector huts or pivot area, all personnel should check
%the spectrometer vacuum gauges. The HMS gauge is located under and near the Q3
%quadrupole. The SOS gauge hangs from the carriage beneath the quadrupole.
%Both gauges are monitored by video cameras and may be viewed
%in the counting house.
%If the spectrometers are under vacuum, the following procedure should be used.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{Before entering detector hut or pivot area, put on hearing
%protection. It is recommended that nobody should be
%closer than 3 feet from the windows without ear protection and that only
%those personnel who need to approach the windows be in their immediate
%vicinity.}
%
%\item{If entering HMS detector hut, close aluminum
%shutter over vacuum window before entering.}
%
%
%\item{If entering pivot area, check both spectrometer windows visually
%(from a distance greater than 3 feet if possible) for obvious wrinkles or
%discoloration. If any are observed, vacate area and
%contact one of the above named personnel. Never touch the vacuum 
%windows.}
%
%\item{Use careful judgement if it is necessary to work near the vacuum
%windows. Do not place objects so that they may fall on the windows, 
%etc.}
%
%\item{Do not work near the windows any longer than is absolutely
%necessary.}
%
%\item{Open aluminum
%HMS exit shutter only when all personnel have left the detector
%hut.}
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\paragraph{Vacuum Window Safety Summary}
%
%Catastrophic window failure would generate a significant shock wave as air
%rushed to fill the evacuated volume. It would make a loud noise which could
%damage the hearing of anyone standing close at hand at the time of failure.
%There are several indicators that something is wrong with the vacuum. If
%any of the following are observed, qualified personnel should be contacted
%and no one should approach the windows until one of those personnel have
%deemed it safe:
%
%
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item{Visual defects, particularly wrinkles, discoloration, or
%uneven fiber stress.}
%
%
%
%\item{Date of removal on tag near spectrometer window indicates
%a date near or after current date.}
%
%
%\item{Vacuum gauges indicating a loss of vacuum
%$\ge 1$ mTorr.}
%
%\item{HMS shutter malfunction (troubles opening or closing).}
%
%\item{The pen-traced ring drawn onto thae window perimeter moving away
%from the perimeter.}
%
%\item{Bolt torque not remaining at installed value
%(only qualified personnel should check for this).}
%
%\item{Deflection increasing above installed value
%(only qualified personnel should check for this).}
%\end{enumerate}

\section{The High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) }

The HMS is composed of three superconducting quadrupole magnets,
Q1, Q2, and Q3, and one superconducting dipole magnet. The quadrupoles
were manufactured for JLab by {\em OXFORD} while the dipole was built for 
JLab by {\em ELIN}.
The quadrupole magnets are referred to as Q1, Q2, and Q3, where a particle first traverses 
Q1, then Q2 and Q3, and finally traverses the dipole magnet.

The magnet system is followed by a large concrete detector hut, in which all
detector elements reside. The main fraction of the detector elements have been
built by universities involved in the Hall~C physics program.

The HMS magnet system is the cornerstone of the Hall~C activities.
Many of the experiments approved in Hall~C center on physics at high
momentum transfers and other short-range phenomena, and rely on a spectrometer
able to momentum analyze charged particles up to very high momenta.
The design value for the maximum momentum accessible to the HMS magnet
system is 6 GeV/c, though in its initial phase the maximum momentum
has been limited to 4 GeV/c.


\subsection{Magnets and Power Supplies}

The HMS magnets are all
superconducting and hence their coils must be maintained at
cryogenic temperatures during operations. The LHe required by the magnets
is supplied by the End Station Refrigerator, ESR.

All the HMS magnets cryogenic services are supplied through the overhead
cryogenic lines. The distribution network begins at the distribution
box over the pivot. This box is connected to the rest of the network via the
flexible transfer lines over the pivot. The network is adjacent to
the upstairs catwalk of the HMS.

Cryogenic information about each magnet is available on the control screens
downstairs, one for each magnet. These are located on the first deck
of the shield house by the ``pasta fork" at the rear of the spectrometer.
Normally during run periods the control screens are sent upstairs to the
Hall~C counting house and information on all the HMS magnets is available
on the HMS control screen located in the center of the main console.
The control of all magnets is described in a following Subsection.

The power supplies for the magnets are located on the carriage
adjacent to the magnets. The supplies are all water cooled and
the water flow rate to the supplies can be seen on the water flow
meter located near the electronics boxes on the floor near the pivot.
Under normal conditions the meter should read
approximately 33 $\%$. This meter views the flow for all the HMS power supplies
(dipole and quads) and a reading of 33 $\%$ corresponds to approximately
20 gallons per minute through the combination of supplies (they are supplied
in parallel).

The front panels of the power supplies are interlocked. Under
no circumstances should the front panel of any supply be opened by anyone other
than authorized personnel. There is a keyed electrical interlock
located in the Hall~C counting house main console to prevent the
power supplies from being energized at inappropriate times.
Personnel listed in the relevant section of the ESAD for the Hall C
Base Equipment maintain a copy
of the key.

When the supplies are energized there are flashing red lights placed at
several locations on the HMS carriage to alert personnel to the magnet
status. There are also signs posted listing the dangers of high magnetic
fields.

The control interface for the power supplies is available through the HMS
control screen in the Hall~C counting house.

\paragraph{Personnel}
In the event that any problems arise during operations of the magnets
qualified personnel should be notified. This includes any prolonged
or serious problem with the source of magnet cryogens (the ESR).
In the weekend and after hours there
will be a designated individual on call for magnet services. Any member of
the Hall~C engineering group is qualified to deal with unusual magnet situations
but in the event of serious problems the chief cryo/mechanical engineer (Paul
Brindza) should be contacted.


\subsubsection{Quadrupole Magnets and Cryogenic Procedures}

\paragraph{Quadrupole Magnets}
The quadrupoles determine the transverse focusing properties of the spectrometer
and to a large extent its acceptance.

All three quadrupoles for the HMS spectrometer are cold iron superconducting
magnets. The soft iron around the superconducting coil enhances the field at
the coil center and reduces stray fields.
The basic parameters for the first quadrupole, Q1, are an effective (actual)
length of 1.89 (2.34) meter and an inner pole radius of
25.0 centimeter. \cite{bi:yan1}
The vacuum vessel
inner radius for Q1 is 20.05 cm. To achieve the lowest possible angle
setting of the HMS spectrometer (with respect to the beam line), Q1 is
made asymmetrical, and is elongated in the vertical direction. For the same
reason a notch in the outer mantle of the Q1 cryo vessel is made, such
that the incident electron beam passes through this notch when the
HMS spectrometer is at its smallest angle of 12.5 degrees.
The other two quadrupoles, Q2 and Q3, are essentially identical with an
effective (actual) length of about 2.10 (2.60) meter and an inner pole radius
of 35.0 centimeter. For these quadrupoles the vacuum vessel inner radius
amounts to 30.0 centimeter.

The maximum operating currents (assuming a 4 GeV/c momentum particle) for the
quadrupoles are about 580 A, 440 A, and 220 A, for Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively.
To establish a correct focusing onto the detector plane with
the quadrupole triplet we may want to cycle the quadrupoles to about 20\% higher
current values, rendering maximum currents of 700 A, 530 A, and 270 A,
respectively. This will render pole field values of 1.25, 1.30, and 0.65 T,
respectively.
The energy stored in the quadrupole fields is sufficient to cause an
unrecoverable quench if all the energy stored is dumped into the
magnets. \cite{bi:hms1}
Therefore a quench protection circuit is incorporated. However, a quench
can only happen if the cryomagnets have a helium level below the coil during
operation.

The operating current to the quadrupole coils is provided by three
Danfysik System 8000 power supplies, which can operate up to 1250 A current
and 5 V voltage. The power supplies are cooled with a combined maximum 
water flow of 45 liters per minute.

In addition to the main quadrupole windings, all quadrupoles have multipole
windings. To further optimize focusing properties of the HMS magnet system
we may operate some of these multipole trim coils
\cite{bi:yan2}.
The operating current for these multipole
corrections is small (the multipole corrections are typically less than
2\% of the main quadrupole field), of order 50 A, and are provided by
three HP power supplies. These power supplies can operate up to 100 A current
and 5 V voltage.

\subsubsection{Dipole Magnet }

The dipole is the dispersive element in the system and 
determines the central momentum of the spectrometer.
The present operations envelope states that the supply may not be
operated at currents above 1300 Amps. This corresponds to a central
momentum of $\approx$4 GeV/c.

The dipole for the HMS spectrometer is a superconducting, cryostable magnet.
Its basic parameters are an effective length of 5.26 meter,
a bend radius of 12.06 meter, and a gap width of 42 cm.
Its actual size is 5.99 meter long, 2.75 meter wide, and 4.46 meter high.
It is configured to achieve a 25 degree bending angle for 4 GeV/c momentum
particles at a central field excitation of 1.11 T.
For the HMS dipole to reach 1.11 T the maximum operating current for the coil
amounts to 1300 A.

The dipole has been designed to achieve cryostability up to a field of 2 T,
and this property has been extensively tested up to a field of 1.11 T.
The cryostable coils are equipped with an energy removal circuit to cover
the possibility of an unrecoverable quench. \cite{bi:hms2}
However, this can only happen
if the helium level drops below the coil during operation.
The current to the coils will be provided by a Danfysik System 8000 power
supply, which can operate up to 3000 A current and 10 V voltage.
This power supply is located on the carriage beside the dipole, and
is cooled with a maximum water flow of 35 liters per minute.
The flow of the magnet cooling water is regulated by flow meters installed
on the floor of Hall~C. The total water flow needed to cool the 4 power
supplies for the HMS magnet system (dipole and quadrupoles) amounts
to 80 liters per minute, with a supply pressure of cooling water for
Hall~C of 250 psi.


\subsubsection{Operation of the HMS Magnets}

\paragraph{Introduction}

This is an abbreviated operating manual for the HMS superconducting
magnets specifically designed for Hall~C experimenters. It provides
instructions for setting currents, invoking NMR field regulation and
general system monitoring.  Curious readers are directed to the
references for more in depth operating instructions and other technical
manuals.

\end{center}

\paragraph{Magnet Currents}

The polarities of the currents in the HMS magnets are such that
Q2 and DIPOLE have the same sign as the charge of the particles
to be transmitted, Q1 and Q3 have the other sign.
To obtain the correct field settings for the HMS superconducting magnets
we use the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
\item{To obtain the predicted current or field settings, run ``field" from
cdaqs1 or cdaqs2 when logged in as cdaq (at the moment
only the point-to-point tune is implemented). Look in the directory 
{\tt ~cdaq/FIELD for the latest version}}
\item{Use the ``setcurrent" values for the Quadrupoles.}
\item{Use the Field Setting Procedure for the Dipole. This will bring the
magnet to a field near but not equal to the desired field.}
\item{Turn field control on for the Dipole. The magnet will go to the
desired field.}
\item{Wait at least 7 minutes for the dipole magnet to settle.}
\end{itemize}

Up to this moment we have not witnessed any clear signature of hysteresis
effects for the dipole magnet. For the quadrupole magnets a small effect
on the field has been witnessed, but only for low currents (typically smaller
than 100 A). A procedure for setting the quadrupoles was developed
and shown to achieve a high
degree of reproducablility in setting the quads at low current.  The procedure
given here is taken from that procedure, but has not yet  been tested.\\
\textbf{The procedure:} 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{On every change of polarity, take the magnet up to 950 Amps 
     (in the new polarity!), then down to zero before setting the
     current.} 
  \item{To set the current the first time after a polarity change 
     go up to 200 Amps higher than the desired current, 
     then down to the desired current.

     This means: to change the polarity and set the current go to 950 Amps,
     down to zero, back up to 950 Amps, and down to the desired setting.}
  \item{Subsequently:
  \begin{itemize}
     \item{Changes to lower currents can be made directly. 
        That is, just set the magnet for the lower current.}
     \item{For changes to higher current, first overshoot 
        by 200 Amps, then come back down to the desired current.}
  \end{itemize}}
\end{enumerate} 
This procedure is called \textbf{CYCLING
THE MAGNET}, and needs to be  followed for all three quadrupoles.

\paragraph{Magnet Selection}

The superconducting magnet keyboard and video signals are transmitted to
the Counting House via a switchable link.  The video is amplified and
the Counting House quality is as good as that in Hall~C.  The keyboard
commands are somewhat slower than the local keyboards but usually work
properly.  Occasionally junk commands (usually a string of dots) appear
in the quad dialogue box due to the switching.  The quads usually ignore
all bad commands.

\paragraph{Selecting a magnet}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\multicolumn{3}{c} {Sequence of keystrokes...How to select a magnet.}\\
\hline
        &Press and hold &``Num lock"	\\
        &Press and hold	&``minus (--)"	\\
        &Release	&``minus (--)"	\\
        &Release	&``Num lock"	\\
        &Press one of	&``A" for Q1	\\

        &		&``D" for Dipole	\\
        &Press		&``Return"	\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Using the keyboard}

\begin{description}
\item{\bf 1~}\hskip0.1in The quadrupoles use only normal keyboard operations
such as
Alphanumeric keys, cursor keys, and return for selection.  The ``Esc"
(escape) key is also used for menu selection.  The ``Home" key is used to
move from the upper screen to the lower screen.  ({\bf Note:} Num Lock
must not be on to use home key on Num pad).
\item{\bf 2~}\hskip0.1in The dipole keyboard has a built in track ball that
is not
emulated in the Counting House.  You must use the cursor keys and then
type ``exec" (execute) to make a selection, i.e. to plot a graph, select
from a screen menu or to access a valve control menu.  The dipole makes
extensive use of the ``f" keys and a menu is always on the bottom of the
screen.
\item{}\hskip0.3in {\bf Note:  F8 exits the program and saves the trend data}
\item{}\hskip0.3in The alpha numeric keys are used as usual although the PDS
(dipole interface) is built around ``point and click" so only an occasional
number entry is required.
\item{\bf 3~}\hskip0.1in Saving Data
\item{\bf 3.1~}\hskip0.1in The quad system saves data for up to 1 week
without operator
intervention. The data must be transferred to floppy disc to ensure
that it is not overwritten.
\item{}\hskip0.3in {\bf Note:} The quad (Paragon) system start command is
``CEBAF"
\medskip
\item{\bf 3.2~}\hskip0.1in The dipole does not automatically save data without
assistance from an operator.  The dipole has a fast ($\sim$ 2 hour)
buffer and a slow ($\sim$ 1 week) buffer.  The data is stored in 1
day/20 min subsets.  The data can be saved by typing
\end{description}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
	&FREEZE/TR=0 	&	& (RETURN)	\\
	&		& and	&		\\
	&FREEZE/TR=1	&	& (RETURN)	\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in The data will also be saved by pressing the F8 key to
exit the
PDS program. You must type ``HMS" (return) at the DOS prompt to restart.
Saving the data is a good idea but exiting the program is not,
therefore exit (F8) only in desperation.
\item{\bf 4~}\hskip0.1in Rebooting
\item{}\hskip0.3in It is possible to perform a soft boot ``CTRL - ALT - DEL"
from the Counting House keyboard.  The remote system has a hard time
transmitting this, possibly because it is too slow.  Multiple tries are
occasionally necessary.  This should not be done except under desperate
circumstances.
An alternative method is via the reboot button located upstairs in
the counting room/data acquistion section.  Turn the knob to the
correct magnet then press and release the reboot button.

\item{}\hskip0.3in {\bf Note:If you need to restart the HMS control screen, the command to issue at the DOS
prompt is "HMS" (without the quotes).}


\end{description}

\paragraph{Checking Cryogenics}

\begin{description}
\item{\bf 1}\hskip0.1in Routine checking
\item{}\hskip0.3in The HMS magnets all operate with liquid level control of a
reservoir. It is therefore sufficient to verify that the liquid level
is near the set point to be assured of cryogenic happiness.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in The setpoints are given in Table 2.8.  The liquid
level is normally within a few \% of these
values.  If
the level is significantly above [85\% for quads or 94\% for the dipole]
the helium reservoirs are overfilling.  This is not harmful and the
levels will return to normal in several hours.  If the level is
significantly below the set points (5\% or more) there is usually
something wrong.  Selecting a time graph of liquid level is helpful in
determining if the situation is a temporary fluctuation or if the
situation is serious.
\item{\bf 2}\hskip0.1in Helium Problem Resolution
\item{}\hskip0.3in If helium liquid level is observed falling, check all four
systems.  If all four systems are losing then call CHL x7405 as the
likely cause is a site wide problem.  CHL will advise if recovery is
short (1-2 hours) or much longer.  If the recovery is short do nothing!
If the recovery is long then it can be beneficial to make some
adjustments in Hall~C.  This requires an access and a knowledgeable
individual, the on-call cryo operator should be summoned.
\item{\bf 3}\hskip0.1in Single System Failures
\item{\bf 3.1}\hskip0.1in Single System Loss of LN$_2$
\item{}\hskip0.3in If a single system is observed losing LN$_2$ you can
wait until
the next day to call someone in as the LN$_2$ usage of all the magnets
is extremely low.  They can go for 24 hours without a refill.
\item{\bf 3.2}\hskip0.1in Single System Loss of LHE Level
\item{}\hskip0.3in This is usually caused by a single computer failure or
components failure.  Call the cryo operator and plan an access to Hall
C. The dipole reservoir will go empty in 1 hour so a quick reaction is
necessary.  The quads take much longer, 4 hours or more to empty
allowing more time to react.  All of the magnets have low level
interlocks so that you can safely operate until they are ``dry."
\item{\bf 4}\hskip0.1in Temporary Loss of LN$_2$ To All Systems
\item{}\hskip0.3in Occasionally during site LN$_2$ delivery, the supply to
Hall~C
is temporarily stopped.  This can be checked by calling CHL@7405.  There
can be local Hall~C problems that result in loss of LN$_2$ to the
magnets. The ``call in" can be deferred to a convenient time for this
kind of problem.

\item{}\hskip0.5in i) type in ``psu:on"
\item{}\hskip0.5in j) type in ``psu:setcur:\#.\#\# (range 0 to 1024.0 amps)
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in The power supply will ramp up to the value selected.  A new
current can be selected by typing in
\end{description}

\begin{center}
psu:setcur:\#.\#\#
\end{center}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in and the power supply will ramp up/down to the selected value.
\medskip
\item{}\hskip0.3in The quad power supply page has several added features that
should help with operations.  There is a listing of the set current from the
Paragon and a readback from the power supply of the set current.  This
insures that communication to the MPS was successful.  The MPS voltage
and current are also displayed to further indicate where ramp up/down is
in progress.  There is a list of MPS interlocks displayed to help
understand trips.
\end{description}


\subparagraph{Resetting a HMS Quadrupole Power Supply}
\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in Occasionally, an HMS quad power supply will trip
off because a real or annoyance power supply fault is sensed. You
should always record any fault indications in the hclog. Once
you have determined that the fault is not real or that it has been
corrected, and that there is no indication of a quench, the power
supply may be reset by executing the following commands:
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.5in a)psu:setcur:0.0
\item{}\hskip0.5in b)reset
\item{}\hskip0.5in c)psu:reset
\item{}\hskip0.5in d)psu:on
\item{}\hskip0.5in e)psu:setcur:277.7 (use appropriate current setting)
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Quadrupole Quench/Dump Switch}
\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in Recovery from a quadrupole quench can now be done
remotely.   There is little or no
possibility of a ``real" quench occurring in the main coils so one should
always reset and continue.  Prudent checks of the system temperature,
pressure and liquid level are wise.  There have been real quenches of
the trim coils that subsequently cause enough noise to trip the main
coil off.  There are other causes of fast discharges but these have all
been the result of electrical noise or a detection level set too low.
There have been no real quenches observed of any quad main coil.
When a quench reset is needed, the dump switch open interlock and
main coil quench interlock are shown on the ILK screen of the
quadrupole display screen.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{\hskip0.3in \bf 1)}\hskip0.1in To remotely reset the dump
switch type the following commands in the proper order.
\end{description}

\begin{description}

switch at the control rack in the hall:
\end{description}

\begin{description}

\subparagraph{Dipole Operation}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in The HMS dipole has three modes of excitation. These are
current control, manual NMR field control and automatic NMR controlled ramp.
The automatic ramp has an overshoot, undershoot, flat top profile and is
fully user adjustable in addition to the default ramp with 10\%
overshoot 5\% undershoot.  This was intended to help stabilize the field
in the event that the iron was worse than expected.  In practice current
control and manual NMR field control are faster and completely capable
of stabilizing the magnet.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{\hskip0.3in \bf 1)}\hskip0.1in Perform the following steps to
operate the
dipole in current control mode.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.5in a) unlock the main breaker
\item{}\hskip0.5in b) turn on the Dipole MPS breaker
\item{}\hskip0.5in c) switch to MPS local
\item{}\hskip0.5in d) clear all interlock on MPS
\item{}\hskip0.5in e) switch back to MPS remote
\item{}\hskip0.5in f) select MPS manual operation from main menu
\item{}\hskip0.5in g) clear any interlocks
\item{}\hskip0.5in h) select NMR stop and wait $\sim$ 1 min.
\item{}\hskip0.5in i) select NMR start and wait $\sim$ 1 min.
\item{}\hskip0.5in j) if MPS interlock appears, try resetting
\item{}\hskip0.5in k) if not clear, then restart NMR and clear
\item{}\hskip0.5in l) enter hi(gh) bit current 0 to 999 for (0 to 99\%).  Example
[100=0.100\%]
\item{}\hskip0.5in m) enter low bit current 0 to 999 for (0.000 to 0.999\%).
Example [100=0.100\%]
\item{}\hskip0.5in n) change settling time if necessary
\item{}\hskip0.5in o) select ``write data to MPS"
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.3in The MPS will ramp up or down to the selected current.
Current changes can be made by just repeating steps l thru o.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item{\hskip0.3in \bf 2.}\hskip0.1in NMR manual field control
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.5in a) unlock main breaker
\item{}\hskip0.5in b) turn on MPS breaker
\item{}\hskip0.5in c) switch to MPS local
\item{}\hskip0.5in d) clear all interlocks on MPS
\item{}\hskip0.5in e) switch back to MPS remote
\item{}\hskip0.5in r) select NMR manual control from main menu
\item{}\hskip0.5in g) reset interlock
\item{}\hskip0.5in NOTE: MPS interlock does not clear by reset
\item{}\hskip0.5in h) restart RS232 (1st time only)

\item{}\hskip0.5in m) start auto measurement
\item{}\hskip0.5in n) start field control
\end{description}


{\sl NOTE:  to turn the dipole off in field control just turn the
NMR off.  This is necessary because 0 Tesla is not on the NMR B/I curve.}

{\sl NOTE:  NMR field control causes an offset in the precision
current transductor that can be several tenths of a percent.}

\paragraph{Dipole Quench Recovery}

The recovery from a dipole quench ``real or imaginary" can be
completely remote.  It is wise to check the coil voltage traces and
system temperature, pressure and liquid level before restarting.  A
restart requires the following steps.


\begin{description}
\item{}\hskip0.5in a) clear interlocks
\item{}\hskip0.5in b) select MPS manual operations
\item{}\hskip0.5in c) set desired current as before
\item{}\hskip0.5in d) select ``write set data"
\end{description}


The HMS dipole has \underbar{never} had a quench.  Even the
failure of a current lead in October '93 did not quench the coil, 
according to the Hall~C engineering staff.  There
have been numerous fast/slow discharges and all were due to electrical
noise, low trip settings, deliberate operator initiated trips, or
interlock dissatisfaction.


\paragraph{Sample Magnet Control Screens:}

The following are typical copies of the various HMS superconducting magnet
control screens. These screens can be checked when scrolling through the pages
of the magnet control program. These typical examples may be used as
references for comparing current values to determine if operations are
reasonable.

Small deviations are {\bf not} to be considered as cause for alarm
but rather {\bf should prompt the operator to look at the trend graph} for the
variable in question. This is at present the best way to determine if the
cryogenic state is deteriorating or is merely just slightly different.
The Key Operators (see ESAD for Hall C Base Equipment)
for the HMS magnets will make adjustments to the control
parameters to suit changing situations but these are usually small (at the
few percent level) changes in valve limits or setpoints.

The following examples will be shown in the subsequent pages:

\subsection{HMS Vacuum System}

	The spectrometer contains five separate vacuum volumes.
These are the isolation vacuums of each of the superconducting
magnets and the main spectrometer volume through which the particles
to be detected travel.

The isolation vacuums are normally cryo pumped by the cold mass when the
magnets are cold and hence have no mechanical pumps
associated with their maintenance. They also have no thin
windows or other hazards and will not be discussed further in this document.

The main spectrometer vacuum
is currently maintained by the two mechanical pumps.
One pump is located between Q3 and the Dipole on the small angle
side of the carriage while the second pump is the backing
pump of the turbo and pumps the spectrometer volume through the turbo.
Presently we do not use the turbo pump to pump the spectrometer volume due to
the high leak rate through the large rear vacuum window in the shield house.
This mechanical pump is located
at the back of the carriage and the turbo is located in the shield house
underneath the end of the vacuum can that protrudes into the detector hut.

The vacuum in the spectrometer may be read out on a gauge that is sitting on the
carriage beneath Q3. There is a TV camera that views this gauge readout and
it is displayed on one of the TV monitors above the console in the hall
C counting house. The absolute value of the vacuum is not the quantity
of interest (until we improve window technology) but rather its rate of change.
Thus far we have maintained fairly stable vacuum over the course of each run
period and if things are functioning normally we should continue to do so.
If the vacuum starts to deteriorate rapidly an expert should be notified.



\subsection{HMS Slit System}
\label{sec:hms_slit}

The HMS slit system is installed on the gate valve housing mounted to the
front face of Q1. It consists of a vacuum box with a slit ladder
mounted into it. The slit ladder has space for three separate slits,
which will typically be one sieve slit and two solid angle defining collimators.
The slits are rectangular blocks of densimet (90\% W and 10\% Cu/Ni)
with a density of 17 g/cm$^3$. The collimators have an octagonal shaped
opening machined into them; the sieve slit has many holes drilled
into it.

The outer size of the collimators is 11.75" vertical by 8.25"
horizontal. The outer size of the sieve slit is 10.00" vertical
by 8.25" horizontal.
Its vertical size is reduced w.r.t. 11.75" due to space constraints.
The sieve slit always has to be installed at the bottom position of the ladder,
so that we can use the shielding of the collimator above it to
clearly distinguish the top row of holes. The central hole
of the sieve slit has a smaller aperture, and two blocked holes
exist to easily distinguish center and directions.
The collimator thicknesses are 2.5", while the sieve slit thickness
is 1.25". The dimensions and shape of the inner aperture of the present
HMS collimators is denoted in Table~\ref{tab:apertures}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\caption{Apertures of Collimators\label{tab:apertures}}
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{} & {} & {} & {} & {} & {} \\
HMS/SOS & d$\Omega$ & Horizontal & Vertical & Shape & Note \\
{} & (msr) & (mr) & (mr) & {} & {} \\
{} & {} & {} & {} & {} & {} \\ \hline
HMS & 6.74 & $\pm$ 27.5 & $\pm$ 70.0 & Octagonal, Flared & Quads Nominal \\
HMS & 6.74 & $\pm$ 27.5 & $\pm$ 70.0 & Octagonal, Flared & Quads Backward \\
{} & {} & {} & {} & {} & {} \\
SOS & 7.55 & $\pm$ 57.5 & $\pm$ 37.5 & Octagonal, Flared & \\
SOS & 3.98 & $\pm$ 32.5 & $\pm$ 35.0 & Octagonal, Flared & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The total depth of the slit box is close to 3.75", which leaves
enough space to later mount scintillators behind the collimators as an active
veto counter (to prevent punch-through of hadrons) and/or to increase
the collimator thickness. Two circular quick-connect flanges are
added for feed-through of possible light guides.

\subsubsection{Operation of the HMS Slit System}\label{sssec:slit_control}
A remote control system consisting of motor/actuators exists to slide
the slits into place. Resolvers specify the exact position of the
slits.  The control box is located downstairs in Hall~C, behind the
blue power supply racks. On the front face there are four buttons for
each spectrometer. These indicate the three different slit positions
and the ``home" position, which denotes that no slit is used at all
(slit ladder in the up position).  Brake cables are added to prevent
the slit ladder from falling in case of a power loss. Next to this an
emergency button is included to electrically shut down the control
system.

{\bf After a power cycle the HMS slit moves itself to the {\it HOME} position,
returning a reading of 0. Thus, after a power failure or other cycle, the slit
must be commanded to a meaningful position using the commands described below.}

Normally, the system is operated remotely. Connect to the controller
using terminal server hctsv7, port 3:

\begin{minipage}{6in}
\begin{enumerate}
\item telnet hctsv7 2003
\item type {\tt \verb|\B|} to connect to HMS, {\tt \verb|\A|} for SOS. (Must be UPPER CASE)
\item {\tt P PFB} gives readback of the current position (see Table \ref{tab:col_pos})
\item To {\em MOVE} the collimators:
   \begin{itemize}
	\item {\tt EN} - to enable motion.
	\item {\tt RUN 10} - follow instructions (see slit numbers and postions at bottom)
	\item After you have reached the correct slit, disable the motor by typing {\tt 1}

   \end{itemize}
\item If necessary, {\tt K} (kill) is the opposite of {\tt EN}
\item Get rid of your session by typing {\tt \verb|ctrl-]|} (both pushed together), then
at the telnet prompt, type {\tt quit}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

Don't forget to get rid of your session. If you do not close your session nobody
else can communicate with the slit controllers.

\begin{table}[!ht]\
\caption{Slit Collimator Positions\label{tab:col_pos}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rlrr}
   &                  &     HMS   & SOS\\
\hline

2) & Large Collimator &       N/A &   3190717\\
3) & Pion Collimator  &  -3096800 &       N/A\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
   
\subsubsection{Hazard Identification}

The principal hazards are:
\paragraph{Magnetic:} There is a significant fringe field at
the entrance and exits of the magnets. This represents a hazard
to people working on the slit system if they are handling magnetic
objects (tools) or to people with pacemakers. In addition the field could erase magnetic
information storage media such as the strips on credit cards.
\paragraph{Mechanical:} At the front of Q1 the housing for a spring loaded gate valve is
mounted. In its normal operation mode a metal gate will be closed with
severe pressure when the electrical power drops. This can cause serious
damage to interfering body parts.  But currently the shutter and
actuator have been removed so this hazard does not exist.  
A similar mechanical problem involves the slit ladder itself. The total weight of
the three slits amounts to approximately 350 Lbs (160 Kg) and can easily
cause serious damage to body parts.

\subsubsection{Hazard Mitigation}

\paragraph{Magnetic}

A sign will be posted which indicates the presence of a high magnetic
field ( this is standard JLab safety signage). The exact wording is
`` High Magnetic Field - No Pacemakers or Credit Cards." There are also
flashing red lights located on the HMS carriage indicating that the
magnet power supplies are energized. Be careful with tools (are they magnetic?)
when you work on the slit boxes with the red lights in a flashing state.

\paragraph{Mechanical}

If the gate valve is ever re-installed, the following safety
procedures should be observed.  Without power, the gate valve assumes its default closed position due to
pressured air. When installing the slit boxes, or working with your hands
in the vicinity of the inside of the gate valve, disconnect first the power
plug of the gate valve, such that the gate valve closes.
In case you need the gate valve to assume a default open position without
power, first relieve the air pressure
with power on, and verify that the default position of the gate valve has
changed to ``open" by removing the power. Paul Hood (x7849) or Mike Fowler
(x7162) can be contacted for more information.

When installing the slit ladder, be careful when you work with your hands
under the slit ladder (like when you are bolting the slit box to the
gate valve). Remove the slit ladder, or {\bf install a support under the slit
ladder to prevent it from falling all the way down}.

A brake system has been included in the control to prevent the slit ladder
from sliding down in case of a power failure.  However, this must not
be relied upon for personnel safey.


\subsection{HMS Carriage and Rotation System }

	The Carriage is the support structure of the spectrometer.

First and foremost as it is a multi leveled structure it is important to keep in
mind that people may be working above you. This means that hard hats should
be worn.

There are two sets of steps on the carriage. The first set of steps
(closer to the pivot, leading to the power supplies) is very
steep (almost like a ladder) and hence extra care should be exercised
while using this set of steps. The second set of steps is at the rear
of the carriage and provides access to the main level as well as to
the catwalk and shield house. Taller individuals should be mindful
when using this flight of steps due to the limited head room at some 
points.

The first level of the carriage is almost at beam height and therefore
the usual precautions associated with working at heights should be followed (note:
safety railings have been installed everywhere possible along the carriage
perimeter, but there may still be unprotected spaces as conditions change).

The entire spectrometer can be rotated. Currently, the angle of the spectrometer
is found using a plumb bob attached to a reference mark on the
carriage frame under the ``pasta fork" at the rear of the spectrometer.
This plumb bob is aligned over survey marks which have been painted
on the floor in red and scribed at 0.5 degree intervals. Rotation of the spectrometer
is accomplished by using the two motors on the carriage itself (the motors on
the shield house bogies are not used in the present rotation system).
These AC motors are controlled by synchronous pulse width modulated
drives which are mounted near the bottom of the shield house steps.

\subsubsection{Remote Rotation}

Cameras are installed to enable readout of the HMS spectrometer angle
(using the plumb bob and the survey marks on the floor).

The wide-lens and zoom cameras located at the entrance and
the exit of Hall~C should be used to visually spot for obstructions
before and during remote rotation.

Limit switches are installed at forward
and backward angles which prevent HMS from rotating to angles more forward than
10.6 degrees and more backward than 85 degrees. To obtain more forward or more
backward angles an access is needed, and rotation has to occur manually
downstairs with spotters. Hard limit switches will be installed to prevent
the spectrometer from rotating out of maximum allowed range.

In case the HMS spectrometer is rotated to more forward angles, pay special
attention to possible interferences of HMS and SOS. Up to this moment
the closest  angle distance we have obtained between SOS and HMS is 28 degrees.

Remote rotation  is accomplished via the PLC located in the Hall.  It
is currently installed in the HMS shield hut for protection from
radiation.  Commands can be issued to the PLC (Texas Instruments 5000), which executes these commands
following algorithms stored in its memory. An EPICS screen is now
used to talk to the PLC.  The advantages of using the PLC are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{No direct access by users to the algorithms, preventing unsafe
rotation attempts (instead, the algorithms have to be loaded locally into
the PLC).}
\item{Rotation of both HMS and SOS by the same smart controller, enabling
security checks of both angle decoders. This renders a better handle on the
minimum allowed angle between the two spectrometers.}
\item{Automatic slower rotation speeds (if desired) if close to desired angle
when using proximity switches.}
\end{itemize}

The PLC communicates directly with the control electronics of several limit
switches, proximity switches, and decoders. Next to the limit switches
also hard limit switches will be installed on the floor to mitigate failure
of the PLC limit switches.


\subsubsection{Personnel Trained for Manual Spectrometer Rotation}

The spectrometer motors may only be controlled by trained personnel.
At least two people are required for spectrometer rotation, one to
run the motors and at least one spotter. Prior to rotating the spectrometer
a visual inspection of the area should be made to insure that there
is nothing in the spectrometer's path or on the rails. During rotation
the spotter should pay special attention to
the cables which run from the
spectrometer to the target motor controller to make sure that
nothing is hung up or stretching.

In case you need to rotate the spectrometer manually, contact one of the trained
personnel listed in Responsible Personnel (chapter 4) in
the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{ESAD}{http://www.jlab.org/Hall-C/document}.

\section{Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS) }

The SOS is composed of one quadrupole and two dipole magnets.
These are all conventional resistive magnets and are powered by standard
power supplies.
The first dipole deflects particles by 33 degrees, while the
second dipole deflects by 15 degrees in the opposite direction, such
that the total bend of the SOS dipoles is 18 degrees.
The two dipole magnets are enclosed in a common yoke.

The SOS quadrupole was assembled at Argonne National Laboratory and
subsequently shipped to JLab. The dipole is a copy of the Medium Resolution
Spectrometer of Los Alamos, and has been assembled at JLab by a collaboration
of Argonne National Laboratory, Los Alamos, and JLab.

The magnet system is followed by a large concrete detector (or shielding) hut,
in which all detector elements can be found. All of these
detector elements have been built by universities and laboratories involved 
in the Hall~C
physics program.

The SOS magnet system combines a large acceptance (solid angle and momentum
acceptance) with a relatively short path length to the focal plane.
The primary object of this spectrometer is to detect short-lived particles
like pions and kaons. In addition, a large fraction of the experimental
program in Hall~C requires a spectrometer with large momentum and solid angle
acceptance to maximize the operational efficiency.
The maximum central momentum attainable with the SOS magnet system is 1.8 GeV/c.

\subsection{SOS Magnets and Power Supplies }

The SOS magnets are powered by large supplies
(160 Volt, 1000 Amps for Quad and D2, 250 Volts, 1000 Amps for D1).
When working on the power supplies, the responsible people will follow
the guidelines in the electrical safety chapter of the `` JLab EH$\&$S
Manual." Further references which should be consulted before power supply
maintenance or operations are attempted are the operating procedure
provided by the manufacture (Inverpower) and the simplified magnet
power supply maintenance procedure.
The connections at the quadrupole are covered with a 1/4 plexiglass, so that they are not exposed.
The cabinet doors for the power supplies are locked.
There is also a crash button in the counting house which is interlocked with
a separate key. When the key is locked off, in crash mode, the power supply
cannot be energized.
In case you need any of the keys, see the Responsible Personnel listed in 
the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{ESAD}{http://www.jlab.org/Hall-C/document}.

Signs have been posted which indicate the presence of a high magnetic
field ( these are standard JLab safety signage). The exact wording is
``High Magnetic Field - No Pacemakers or Credit Cards." There
are also flashing red lights located near the exit of the last dipole
and near the entrance of the dipole at the pivot that indicate that the
magnet power supplies are energized.

The magnets and their power supplies
are cooled by the Hall~C Low Conductivity Water system (LCW).
The LCW system for the dipole and quadrupoles has been
plumbed using hoses rated for 600 PSI. These hoses have been tested during
the magnet mapping. The cooling water is delivered at 240 PSI.

The spectrometer is in Hall~C and the power supplies are located
behind the blue electronics racks on the HMS side of the hall.
The control of the magnets is available through VME, and will be
described in a subsequent Section.


\subsubsection{SOS Magnet - Description}

The SOS consists of 3 magnets: a quadrupole (QS), followed by two dipoles housed
in a common yoke (BM01 and BM02). All three are resistive magnets
with pressurized water cooling. They are powered by 3
InverPower remotely controlled power supplies, located in the blue racks at
the north side of Hall~C. Group-3 Digital Tesla meter hall probes
are used to monitor the magnetic fields.

The magnets are aligned as a vertical-bend Q, D, -D spectrometer: BM01 bends
charge=1 particles of the central momentum upwards by 33 degrees, and BM02 bends
the central ray down by 15 degrees, resulting in a slope of 18 degrees through
the detectors. QS focuses in the non-bend plane, and defocuses in the bend
plane. Focusing in the bend plane is provided by the dipoles, which have tilted
and curved entrance and exit edges. The ``standard" tune has first-order
point-to-point focusing in both the bend and non-bend planes at the ``standard"
reconstruction plane, located approximately at the first drift chamber (DC1).
An alternate tune with parallel-to-point focusing in the non-bend plane can be
achieved by lowering the excitation of QS and changing the location of the
focal plane. The power-supplies contain a motorized internal bus that can 
reverse
the output polarity so that operation for either positive or negatively charged
particles is possible.

Both BM01 and BM02 require an asymptotic field (far from the edges) of 11379.3
Gauss/GeV for the central ray. While the center of BM01 is far from the edges,
BM02 is a thin magnet, and there is no region that isn't close to the entrance
and exit edges. The proper relative excitation of these magnets is determined
by numerically integrating the central ray's trajectory through the fields
measured during the mapping of these magnets, and by comparing the observed and
expected trajectories of the central ray through the drift chambers.

The ``standard tune" requires a gradient of approximately 498.152 Gauss/cm/GeV
in QS. The excitation of QS relative to BM01 was determined by observing
electrons that passed through a sieve-slit mask at the entrance to QS after
scattering elastically from a carbon target. The field in QS was varied until
the correct focus was observed at the reconstruction plane.

The maximum central momentum of the spectrometer is approximately 1.75 GeV.
This limit is imposed by the power supplies; at this setting BM01 requires
approximately 1000 amps, and QS requires approximately 170 volts. 
Table~\ref{tab:sos_ratings}
lists the maximum output voltage and current of each power supply. However, the
iron in the magnets is significantly saturated at this setting, and a 
significant
increase in the central momentum probably can't be achieved without affecting
the optics.

\begin{table}

\end{table}

All three magnets are equipped with Group-3 precision hall-effect probes to
monitor their fields. BM01 and BM02 are equipped with LPT-141 probes that are
glued onto the pole tips inside the magnet vacuum with Torr seal epoxy. The cables
from the probes are routed inside the magnets to the transition vacuum piece
between QS and BM01, where they pass through a feed-through. The BM01 probe was
placed near the center of the pole, in the uniform field region. The BM02 probe
was placed near the widest part of the pole. in both cases, the probe location
is outside of the beam envelope accepted by the spectrometer.

QS is equipped with a LPT-130 probe located in an aluminum holder mounted in an
access hole of one of the stainless-steel spacers between the upper and lower
pole pieces. This positions the probe in the horizontal midplane of the magnet,
in the region where the upper and lower pole pieces are closest together. The
field at this point is proportional to the field gradient in the magnet bore, in
the absence of saturation. Saturation effects are estimated by the 2D magnet
code Poisson, but the precise tune of the magnet relative to BM01 can only be
determined experimentally.

The cables for all three hall-probes are bundled together at the transition
piece between QS and BM01. The cables for BM01 and BM02 have a connector that
attaches to the feed thrus on the top of the transition piece. (There is a
corresponding connector inside the magnet vacuum.) The feed thru for BM01 is
the one closest to the target. It is extremely important that the external
connections for BM01 and BM02 not be interchanged. This is because the cables
terminate in a small connector containing a PROM with the calibration table for
that specific probe. Although the probes will operate with the wrong cable, the
field values will be incorrect. The cables, connectors, and feed thrus are
labeled for correct assembly.

The bundled hall-probe cables are routed back through the dipole yoke, around
the inside of the shield house, and through the rear-wall penetrations to the
electronics shack. The readout-electronics are located in one of the lefthand
relay racks, as one stands facing the target. BM01 and BM02 probes are connected
to DTM-141 units, QS is connected to a DTM-132 unit. These units are
daisy-chained together with a fiber-optic link, and communicate with crate
VMEC9 via an RS232 serial I/O port.

\subsubsection {SOS Magnets - Operation}

IMPORTANT: Before any power is applied to the magnets, you must make sure that
the cooling water is flowing through them. There are two circuits controlled by
the spectrometer water-rack located near the spectrometer pivot. One supplies
water to QS, and is labeled TEST. The other supplies both BM01 and BM02; it's
labeled SOS. Visually check the flow gauge.
%Typical values are ??? for QS and ??? for SOS.
Refer to the section on the LCW system for the procedure to turn the water on and off.

IMPORTANT: The SOS power supplies are themselves water cooled, and you must
make sure that the cooling water is flowing through them before energizing
their AC power circuit breakers. The water rack for the power supplies is
located immediately to the left of the power supplies as you face their front.
Refer to the section on the LCW system for the procedure to turn the cooling water on and off.
Visually check the flow gauge.
%typical values are ??? for QS, ??? for BM01, and ??? for BM02.

The SOS power supplies may be controlled either locally through their front
panel, or remotely by computer. The normal mode of operation is by computer.

Remote control of the power supplies is performed through an interactive
computer program run on VME crate VMEC19. To access the controls, telnet to
vmec19.jlab.org. As a security precaution, telnet access is only allowed
from Hall C computers, and you must login with a username and
password.  The username and password are available
from Steve Wood on request.

Once logged in, the control program is started by the command ``sos".  This
results in a display of the current power status, plus a prompt for a
command. The display does not update automatically.  To update the
display, hit return key.  Typing a number from the list of defined
commands followed by a return key performs that command.

If question marks appear in the display, then the program is unable to
communicate with the power supplies. The question marks might appear when
the program first starts, but should be replaced with numbers when the
display is updated.  If the question marks do not go away, you should
consult an expert to diagnose the problem.

Most of the commands involve controlling a particular supply. This supply must
first be SELECTED by one of the commands. The supply currently selected is
indicated by ``SSS" appearing below the column of numbers for that magnet. (On
startup, no magnet is selected, and the ``SSS" will not be displayed.)

Before controlling the magnets, you should check the fault-status of the supply.
This status may be displayed by one of the commands available from the main
menu. The table which is displayed shows ``." for normal status. Any other symbol
appearing indicates a fault that will prevent the supply from operating. Most
faults are related to internal parts of the power supply. Key/crash is the
magnet power-permit key located on the control-room console near the telephones.
This key must be turned on before the supplies will supply current. The magnet
coils contain temperature-sensitive relays at all of the cooling water outlets;
these relays will open if they get get too hot and trip the SPARE 1 fault.

If any faults are indicated, you can try to reset the faults via one of the
main-menu commands. If this doesn't clear the fault, you should consult an
expert to diagnose the problem. Note that the reset is only performed on the
currently selected magnet.

There are 3 commands affecting the current in the selected magnet: ON, OFF,
and SET CURRENT. In addition, there are commands to set the polarity to
Normal (+) or reverse (-). Current setpoints are always entered as positive
numbers, regardless of the polarity.

IMPORTANT: Do not attempt to change the polarity unless the magnet has been
turned OFF and the output current has ramped down to 0.1 amps or less. Damage
to the power supply might otherwise occur!

Setting a current in the magnet while it is off merely changes the setpoint.
When it is turned on, it will go to that current.

Setting a current while the magnet is on will cause the supply to ramp up or
down to the new current. Note that large decreases in the current have a
tendency to trip off the power supply.

Any change in current will cause eddy currents in the magnet yokes that must
damp out before the field stabilizes at the new value. The settling time for the
bending magnets is anywhere from 2-10 minutes, depending on the size of the
change, the level of saturation in the iron, and desired accuracy of the final
field. The quadrupole settles much more quickly, and can be ignored. The
settling of the magnets can be observed using the hall probes, as discussed
below.

When changing the spectrometer currents, one normally always makes changes in
the same direction, always going either up or down, to stay on the same
hysteresis curve. You should also try to make changes in both magnets
concurrently, or in steps of 100 amps or less in each magnet in series, to stay
on the same hysteresis curve. If you have to go in the other direction for other
than a small step, you should degauss the whole spectrometer.

There are two philosophies regarding operating spectrometer magnets. The first
is to always follow a hysteresis curve down from full saturation. In this case,
``degaussing" consists of energizing the magnets to full power, and then
following the hysteresis curve down to the setpoint. This method doesn't
actually degauss the magnet, and at zero current there will be a residual field.

The second method is to run the magnets up to full power, then down to zero,
change polarity, set the magnets to a specific current, and then back down to
zero, change polarity again, and then go to the desired current. The
back-polarity point is chosen such that following the hysteresis curve back to
zero current leaves zero residual field at zero current. Thus, the actual
operating points all lie on the hysteresis curve which passes through the
zero-current, zero-field point.

The second method allows the zero-offset of the hall probes to be reset, if
needed, when the field is known to be zero (see the next section for this
procedure). Also, if the maximum possible
currents change, (for example, if the supplies are upgraded or experience
problems), then the back-polarity setpoint can be altered to compensate.
Thus, this is the preferred method to use.

To degauss using the second method, first raise all magnets to the currents for
1.75 GeV (see procedure below) and let the fields stabilize for 2-5 minutes.
Turn all magnets OFF as close together in time as possible, and let them ramp
down to 0.1 amp or less. Change the polarities to the opposite of the initial
sign. Set BM01 and BM02 to 75 amps, QS to 75, and turn them on. Let the fields
settle for 2 minutes, and turn them off. Switch the polarities back to the
original. After settling for 2 minutes, the magnets are degaussed.

\subsubsection{Setting the SOS Hall Probe Zero Offsets}
 
The procedure for setting the SOS Hall probe
zero-offsets is as follows.

To accurately set the zero registers, you need to degauss the SOS
and then follow this procedure:
\begin{description}
\item{1.}Go to the terminal window with the SOS magnet control program.
\item{2.}Exit the SOS magnet control program.
\item{3.}Type \verb|stopsos|
\item{4.}Type \verb|cd "~cvxwrks/SLOWC/SOS"| (DOUBLE QUOTES NEEDED)
\item{5.}Type \verb|ld < hallcmd.o|
\item{6.}Type \verb|hallcmd|
\item{7.}Type \verb|a03 ia| (This addresses probe 3, ie, the quad, and asks for
     the autorange status: 0 for off, 1 for on. It should be on and
     return a value of 1.)
\item{8.}If autoranging is off for some reason,
     turn it on by typing \verb|sb1|, and then check it by typing \verb|ia|.
\item{9.}Type \verb|z| to initiate zeroing. In autorange mode, this causes
    all field range zero registers to be updated such that the
    hall probe reads 0.0 Gauss on all ranges. This takes about 10
    seconds during which the hall probes will ignore new commands,
    so {\em DON'T TYPE ANYTHING FOR 15 SECONDS!!!}
\item{10.}Type \verb|iz| to see what the zero register is on range 0. It should
    return a number within a few Gauss of 170 Gauss.
\item{11.}Type a return with no preceeding characters to exit the program.
\item{12.}Type \verb|sos| to restart the normal control program.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Operating Procedure for SOS and HNSS Power Supplies}

\paragraph {Operating Procedures}

The following is the procedure to operate the PS unit.
The Operation modes must be selected before the PS unit is to
start.

\subparagraph {Operation Mode Setting}

The following modes of operation can be chosen:

\begin{description}
\item{1.} LOCAL/REMOTE
\item{2.} NORMAL/REVERSE POLARITY
\end{description}

Polarity can be set remotely (by the customer computer) or locally
(by the ``REMOVABLE OPERATOR PANEL" (ROP) soft keys) and L/R is set
locally only.

The setup is as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{1.} Turn on the water cooling system
\item{2.} Close all cabinet doors.
\item{3.} Turn on the main circuit breaker (CB1) at the front of the
input compartment.
\item{**} {\bf Warning:} 480V is present on the CB1, CR1, CR2 and primary of
TR2 and LSTM modules!!!
\item{4.} Check the LCD Display for PS status (ON/OFF/FAULT),
(LOCAL/REMOTE), (NORM/REVERSE). Choose appropriate modes by using the 
panel
``Soft Keys" (MODE/SELECT/ENTER/UP/DOWN).
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Local Start Up Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check all the interlocks (LED's on the Eurocard modules).  The
``Standby" LED on the ``CM" module should be ``OFF" indicating the correct
``SLR" regulator temperature.  If it is not, wait for a few minutes to
allow the on-board Peltier element to heat up/cool down the regulator
box temperature.  Check that the ``CDR" LED is off.
\item Set the reference to 0.0 by pressing ``0" key on the keypad.
\item If there are any fault/interlocks activated, they can be reset by
``ROP" ``RESET" key.
\item Start the unit by a local ``ROP" ``START" soft key.
\item Set the output current by changing the reference using the
``ROP" ``UP/DOWN" soft keys or by a keypad.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Local Stop Procedure}

Press the ``ROP" ``STOP" key.  The contactors CR1, CR2 open and
the discharging contactor CDR discharges the dc bus electrolytic
capacitors.

\subparagraph{Remote Start Up Procedure}

If the remote mode is chosen all commands and references are
selected by computer via RS232 link.

\paragraph{Maintenance}

This sub-section describes a simple procedure to solve the minor
problems encountered in a PS malfunction.

When a malfunction of the PS occurs, all the faults are recorded
in the ``SIM" module and are available at the ``ROP" LCD display as well
as on the remote computer monitor (first fault included).  Refer to
 Table~\ref{tab:ps_ts_1} and \ref{tab:ps_ts_2} for a description of
the meaning of the various LEDs on the display panel, and

operation.

{\bf NOTE:} Always check that the interface cables in the electronic
compartment are secure.  Also check tightness of the EBPB board's

\subparagraph{Device Changing Procedure}

When changing a puck device, the clamp nuts must be removed by
quarter turns of the wrench alternating between nuts.  See device
changing procedure below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove gating leads from defective device (if applicable).
\item Loosen clamp torque-nuts by alternatively loosening each nut
1/4 turn.
\item Pry apart the bus bar, holding the device in place.
\item Replace the SCR.  Coat the SCR surfaces with Alcoa EJC joint
compound. Note the device polarity and orientation.
\item Tighten the torque nuts finger tight, ensuring that each has
been tightened evenly, and that the torque spring bar is perpendicular
to the SCR stack.
\item Tighten the torque nuts with a torque wrench by alternately
tightening each nut 1/4 turn until 160 inch pounds has been applied on
each.
\item Reconnect all gate leads and power leads.
\end{enumerate}

When changing a MOSET on a power module, the control wires and
water connections must be removed (quick connects).  The module can be
pulled out by pulling on the module handle.  Before mounting a new
device, a thin coat of Alcoa EJC joint compound should be applied to the
MOSET surface.  MOSETs are tightened to the heat sink only by two
screws.  After replacement, one has to make sure that all the wires are
returned to the right connection points.


\paragraph{Special Tooling}

The following power electronics instrumentation is required to
service the PS unit:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Dual Beam Oscilloscope c/w 10 x probe.
\item Good quality Multimeters.
\item Diode/SCR Tester.
\item 500/1000 volt dc/ac Megger.
\item 1000 volt ac/dc Voltmeter.
\item 300 in/lb capacity Torque Wrench.
\end{enumerate}

It is beneficial to have a lifting tool or equipment capable of
2500 lbs (1140 kg) for removal of magnetics (TR1, TR2, LF). These
components are front and rear exited from the enclosure.


\paragraph{Safety and Preventative Maintenance}

\subparagraph{Safety}

The Maintenance Technician should become familiar with the layout
and be aware of basic system parameters.  Only qualified technicians
should be allowed to work with this equipment under competent
supervision.

The DC Bus Capacitor in the power conversion compartment could be
charged up to 290 VDC volts.  These will normally quick discharge in
``Off" mode through CDR contactor and RD resistors.  The time to
discharge is approximately one (1) second.  In any case, check the DC
bus voltage, before servicing the unit.

The Technician must be aware of the energy sources fed into the
PS unit.  This is 480V, 60 Hz, 3$\phi$.  The 120 Vac for the auxiliary
circuits and electronics is derived from that voltage through F4, F5
fuses and TR3 transformer in the rear compartment.

\subparagraph{Preventative Maintenance}

General housekeeping is the key to maintaining power electronic
and electrical equipment.  The area is to be kept clean and as dust free
as possible when doors are open.  A schedule program of inspection will
reduce the possibility of problems.

After the first month of operation it is recommended that all
hose clamps, power connections and circuit board connections be checked.
 The procedure should be repeated after six months and every year
thereafter.

\begin{description}
\item{1.} Power Components - Electronic
\item{}\hskip0.3in To be kept clean and free of dirt and obstructions.
This will avoid tracking and heat build-up, thereby increasing the life of the
devices.
\item{2.} Capacitors
\item{}\hskip0.3in Capacitor forming takes place each time the PS is started.
If the PS has not been started in six (6) months, the CF electrolytic
capacitors may require reforming.
\item{3.} Control Components - Electronic
\item{}\hskip0.3in The Printed Circuit Boards are to be kept clean and free
of any accumulations of dirt and foreign material.
\item{}\hskip0.3in Static materials should never be allowed near PCB's while
in PS or in stores.  Caution should be used when near or handling PCB's.
\item{}\hskip0.3in There are no special requirements (other than housekeeping
standards) for the maintenance of the logic control components.
\item{4.} Power Components - Magnetic
\item{}\hskip0.3in General housekeeping and clean environment.
\item{Note:} All Items above are subject to thermal degradation and good
housekeeping is the prime method of maintaining original design
parameters.
\item{5.} Plumbing Components
\item{}\hskip0.3in The major components requiring preventative maintenance are
in the plumbing system.
\item{}\hskip0.3in Periodic checking of the water pressure annunciations will
ensure that water flow reduction will give the appropriate alarm.
\item{}\hskip0.3in Turn the unit's cooling circulation ``ON".  Check all hose
connections for leaks or looseness.  Check for any worn hoses (at
clamps) due to heat.
\end{description}

\subsection{SOS Vacuum System }

The entire volume of the SOS spectrometer, from the entrance window in the
front of the quadrupole to the exit window at the exit of the second dipole,
inside the detector hut,
can be evacuated. This in order to minimize the effects of multiple
scattering on the SOS performance. As is the case with HMS vacuum can,
the entrance and exit are covered
by mylar-kevlar composite vacuum windows.

The spectrometer vacuum is maintained by a single Leybold 1000 liter
turbo pump and the vacuum is read with a cold cathode gauge.
This can be displayed on one of the TV monitors in the Hall~C
counting house.

Since the exit window of the SOS vacuum system has under 1/3 the stress of the
large HMS exit window, and has a very sizable safety margin,
no kevlar ``Blast Shield" has been installed.
Signs indicating the presence of thin vacuum windows have been posted in the
shield house and at the pivot point.


\subsection{SOS Slit Systems}

\subsubsection{SOS Slit Box}

The SOS slit system is directly mounted to the vacuum can of the SOS quad.
Like the HMS slit system, it consists of a vacuum box with a slit
ladder mounted into it. The slit ladder has space for three separate slits,
which will typically be one sieve slit and two solid angle defining collimators.
The slits are rectangular blocks of densimet (90\% W and 10\% Cu/Ni)
with a density of 17 g/cm$^3$. The collimators have an octagonal shaped
opening machined into them, the sieve slit has many holes drilled
into it.

The outer size of all slits (solid-angle defining collimators and
sieve slits) are 8.25" vertical times 11.75" horizontal.
The central hole of the sieve slit has a smaller aperture, and two blocked
holes exist to easily distinguish center and directions. Next to this
the horizontal spacing of the three innermost columns of holes is
reduced such that we can use the same slit when we run the SOS spectrometer
in its parallel-to-point tune (default is point-to-point).
The collimator thicknesses are 2.5", while the sieve slit thickness
is 1.25". The dimensions and shape of the inner aperture of the present
SOS collimators is included in Table~\ref{tab:apertures} in the section on the HMS 
 slit system.

Similar to the HMS aperture,
the total depth of the slit box is close to 3.75", which leaves
enough space to later mount scintillators behind the collimators as an active
veto counter (to prevent punch-through of hadrons) and/or to increase
the collimator thickness. Two circular quick-connect flanges are
added for feed-through of possible light guides.

The remote control system for the SOS slit system is completely analogous
to the HMS slit system (see Section~\ref{sssec:slit_control}),
and built into the same control box
(behind the blue power supply racks on the floor of Hall~C).
Four buttons are included on the front face for SOS, denoting ``home" and
the three slit positions.
The emergency button shuts down the full control system, and thus both motion
of HMS slit ladder and SOS slit ladder.

%\subsubsection{Movable Jaw System}

%To the front of the SOS slit box a 10" inner diameter gate valve is installed.
%In front of that one either installs a 11.1" long vacuum spool piece,
%for normal operations, or the so-called ``SOS Movable Jaw System."
%The latter system is borrowed from SLAC and consists of an independent
%horizontal and vertical movable slit system, to be used for calibration
%purposes. {\bf Note that with this system installed the minimal scattering
%angle SOS can obtain is limited to 21 degrees.}
%All slits or jaws consist of Tungsten with a layer of Copper around it.
%The vertical moving
%slits have a (rectangular) size of 4.5" high times 10" wide times 4" thick,
%and can move independently. The horizontal moving slits have a
%(rectangular) size of 12" high times 5.5" wide times 4" thick, and are
%moved together by a single motor.
%Motion of the jaws is performed by applying 110 V through a push-button-relay
%system to three single-phase AC motors, while visual displays show the optical
%encoder settings. To move control from down in Hall~C to up in the counting
%house, and vice-versa, one has to swap cables.

\subsubsection{Hazard Identification}

The principal hazards are
\paragraph{Magnetic} There is a significant fringe field at
the entrance and exits of the magnets. This represents a hazard
to workers handling magnetic objects (tools) and to personnel with
pacemakers. In addition the field could erase magnetic
information storage media such as the strips on credit cards.
\paragraph{Mechanical}
In front of the SOS slit box a vacuum gate valve is mounted.
In its normal operation mode a metal gate will be closed with
severe pressure when the electrical power drops. This can cause serious
damage to interfering body parts.
A similar problem involves the slit ladder itself. The total weight of
the three slits amounts to approximately 350 Lbs (160 Kg) and can easily
cause serious damage to body parts.

\subsubsection{Hazard Mitigation}

\paragraph{Magnetic} A sign will be posted which indicates the presence of 
a high magnetic
field ( this is standard JLab safety signage). The exact wording is
`` High Magnetic Field - No Pacemakers or Credit Cards." There are also
flashing red lights located on the HMS carriage indicating that the
magnet power supplies are energized. Be careful with tools (magnetic?)
when you work on the slit boxes with the red lights in a flashing state.

\paragraph{Mechanical} When performing manual labor in the vicinity 
of the vacuum gate
valve either close the gate valve or block the gate valve such that
it can not accidentally close on you.

When installing the slit ladder, be careful when you work with your hands
under the slit ladder (like when you are bolting the slit box to the
gate valve). Remove the slit ladder, or {\bf install a support under the slit
ladder to prevent it from falling all the way down}.

A brake system has been included in the control to prevent the slit ladder
from sliding down in case of a power failure.

The SOS movable jaw system {\bf only} moves when power is available and
a push-button is used. Its default is not to move at all.

\subsection{SOS Carriage and Rotation System }

\subsubsection{Introduction}

	The Carriage is the support structure of the spectrometer.
Note that the safety issues associated with the carriage are not included
in the \htmladdnormallink{ESAD}{http://www.jlab.org/Hall-C/document},
and will be discussed here.

First and foremost as it is a multi leveled structure, it is important to keep in
mind that people may be working above you. This means that hard hats should
be worn.

The steps to enter the SOS carriage are at the back of the spectrometer.
The first level of steps brings one to the electronics shed, where all
SOS data acquisition electronics and cable racks are located.
A second level of steps brings one to the platform along the
shield house, giving access to all detectors and the SOS High Voltage
power supplies.
A third level of steps leads
to the top of the spectrometer, where the motor to control the door
mechanism and the hut air conditioning system are situated.
Access to this level should be limited to
persons performing maintenance or repair work. A chain normally
prevents access to this level.

On all stages of the SOS carriage
all the usual precautions associated with heights should be followed.
Safety railings have been installed everywhere along the carriage perimeters.

The entire spectrometer can be rotated. The angle of the spectrometer
can be manually determined using a plumb bob attached to a reference mark on the
carriage frame at the rear of the spectrometer.
This plumb bob is aligned over survey marks which have been painted
on the floor in red at 0.5 degree intervals. Rotation of the spectrometer
is accomplished by using the two motors on the carriage itself.
These AC motors are controlled by synchronous pulse width modulated
drives which are mounted near the bottom of the shield house steps.

\paragraph{Remote Rotation}


During rotation constant visual inspection with the two wide-lens, zoom Hall~C
cameras is obligatory. This visual inspection should ensure that nothing
blocks the spectrometer path (either on the rails or on the floor), that there
is no interference with either HMS or beam line, and that the flexible cable
trays do not get stuck.

Limit switches will be installed at forward
and backward angles which prevent SOS to rotate to angles more forward than
20 degrees. To obtain more forward or more
backward angles an access is needed, and rotation has to occur manually
downstairs with spotters. Hard limit switches will be installed to prevent
the spectrometer to rotate out of their maximum allowed range.

In case the SOS spectrometer is rotated to more forward angles, pay especially
close attention to interferences between the HMS and SOS. Up to this moment the closest angle
distance we have obtained between SOS and HMS is 35 degrees.

Remote rotation  is accomplished via the PLC remote controller in the Counting House. 
Remote spectrometer rotation occurs by computer. Commands can be
issued to a PLC (Texas Instruments 5000), which executes these commands
following algorithms stored in its memory. The PLC is situated at the first
level of the HMS carriage, opposite to the magnet power supplies.
The advantages of using the PLC are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{No direct access by users to the algorithms, preventing unsafe
rotation attempts (instead, the algorithms have to be loaded locally into
the PLC).}
\item{Rotation of both HMS and SOS by the same smart controller, enabling
security checks of both angle decoders. This renders a better handle on the
minimum allowed angle in between both spectrometers.}
\item{Automatic slower rotation speeds (if desired) if close to desired angle
when using proximity switches.}
\end{itemize}

The PLC communicates directly with the control electronics of several limit
switches, proximity switches, and decoders. Next to the limit switches
also hard limit switches will be installed on the floor, to prevent failure
of the PLC limit switches.


\paragraph{Manual Local Rotation by Authorized Personnel}

The spectrometer motors may only be controlled by trained personnel.
Manual remote rotation of the SOS may only be done by the 
Hall~C staff members responsible for the Carriage and Rotation
System (listed in the 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{ESAD}{http://www.jlab.org/Hall-C/document}).  
At least two people are required for spectrometer rotation, one to
run the motors and at least one spotter. Prior to rotating the spectrometer
a visual inspection of the area should be made to insure that there
is nothing in the path of the spectrometers or on the rails. During rotation
the spotter should pay special attention to the flexible cable ducts,
to make sure that nothing is hung up or stretching.


\subsubsection{Carriage}

The Short Orbit Spectrometer steel carriage consists of four pieces; a pivot
section; main carriage body and two pairs of locomotive style wheels. On
top of the carriage is a concrete detector shield house. Attached to the rear
of the concrete shield house is a prefab steel electronics hut. Personnel
access is provided to the electronics hut, shield house door (and to the
target area near the pivot).

The concrete shield house is constructed of high density concrete with
0.5\% boron frit (by weight) additive. High density concrete contains
aggregate that is 66\% iron ore and is almost 40\% heavier (208 lb/ft$^3$) by
weight than standard concrete (150lb/ft$^3$). The concrete is 24" thick on all
six sides. The inside walls and roof of the shield house are lined with panels
consisting 2" of lead poured into boxes with 1/4" steel sides. The rear
interior wall and the shield house floor are lined with 2" steel plates.

Access to the detector stack is through a vertically opening counter
weighted door. The door operates by electronically controlled hydraulic
cylinders.

\subsubsection{Pivot}

The SOS pivot surrounds the top half of the center pivot in Hall~C. The
pivot section is bolted to the main carriage. The SOS has two bearing
surfaces upon which it moves. The cross roller bearing provides horizontal
rotation. The spherical bearing allows out of plane movement.

Both bearing surfaces are lubricated with grease. Periodic regreasing of
these bearings will eliminate problems.

The spherical bearing race is provided with grease zircs that are accessible
through access cut-outs in the pivot housing. The bearing should be
regreased before out of place movement if out of plane operation is infrequent.
Two surfaces of the spherical bearing race are covered with Teflon
film. When the Teflon deteriorates the bearing will need to be greased more
often. Failure to grease the bearings could result in rough movement and
binding. The cross-roller bearing has several grease zircs along the top
surface of the spherical bearing race.

\subsubsection{Wheels and Angle Readout}

The SOS wheels are constrained to rotate on a track 35' from the central
pivot. Each wheel pair contains a drive wheel and an idler wheel. Each
drive wheel has its own motor and controller. The design allows the
spectrometer to rotate with just one of the two motors operating. The
recommended procedure is for running two motors together as this reduces stress
on the system. The motor controllers are located in a steel cabinet at the
bottom of the stairway at the rear of the spectrometer. The controllers are
supplied with 480V. The circuit for these is in the C-UPH3 box on the non-door
side of the shield house. There is not an ``ON" switch, the controller LED's
are lit if the circuit is on. Past experience has shown that 30Hz setting is a
reasonable movement rate. This results in a change of approximately 1
degree per minute. Fine adjustment can be made at 10Hz pretty easily.

{\bf The forward direction on the controller is a counter-clockwise rotation.}

There is a white C-beam welded to the centerline of the carriage a few feet
downstream of the track. A scribe line on a red background at its base is
used for angle positioning by aligning to survey marks on the floor. The
scribe line is along the same centerline used to align the dipole and quadrupole
magnets. A camera is mounted to the beam to allow
remote visual readout. Manual control involves starting and stopping the
motor(s) by hand until the desired angle is reached.

\subsubsection{Rotation}

\paragraph{Pre-Rotation Checkout}

Prior to rotation the track should be inspected and cleared of objects. This
includes the track area under the carriage between the wheels. Previously,
the track has had brooms, nuts, bolts, water hose and cables lying across it.
All obstructions must be moved before the SOS is rotated.
The area around the spectrometer also needs to be cleared of materials.

If the track is clear, rotation between 20 degrees and 140 degrees is not a
problem. At angles smaller than 20 and larger than 140 degrees care must
be used to prevent the SOS from hitting stuff. The data cable ``elephant
trunk" under the SOS needs to be monitored and moved so that it does not
bind and tear loose from its' mounting points. The fouls at small angles are
related to the scattering chamber, beam dump vacuum pipe, the HMS and
the cables and connections on the SOS quadrupole. At large angles the
SOS will foul with the beamline and the access stairway near the pivot.
Rotation at a slow speed with persons watching from the pivot area can
avoid equipment damage. Until the quadrupole is refitted with a new coil
the minimum angle possible is 18 degrees.

\paragraph{Manual Rotation}

To rotate the SOS manually perform the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Inspect and clear the track.}
\item{Turn on the motor circuits 8,10,12 and 14,16,18 in circuit box C-UPH3}
\item{Secure the door to motor the controller box open}
\item{Set frequency as desired (30Hz for general movement 10Hz for fine
control)}
\item{Press forward or reverse direction to move spectrometer.}
\item{Press stop at the desired angle.}
\item{Repeat if desired.}
\end{enumerate}




\subsubsection{Out-of-Plane Jacks}

The Short Orbit Spectrometer is designed to allow out-of-plane operation.
Two hydraulic jacks are attached to the rear section of the carriage. They
can be used for leveling the spectrometer and lifting the SOS out of plane. A
third large hydraulic cylinder is attached diagonally from the right jack
base to the bottom of the carriage on the left.  Presently use of
this system is disabled.

The design allows a 20 degree tilt above the beamline. When the SOS
wheels are on the rails the spectrometer is declined by 0.15 degrees below
the beamline. Until a jack control system is available to level the
spectrometer the SOS will be declined during data taking.
