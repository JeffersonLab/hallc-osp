Several types of mutually exclusive target systems are used in Hall C,
including:

\begin{list}{\arabic{enumi}.~}{\usecounter{enumi}\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
  \item a system of cryo-targets and solid targets;
  \item a target of polarized gaseous $^3$He.
  \item a target of polarized $\textrm{NH}_3$ or $\textrm{ND}_3$.
\end{list}

The set of cryogenic targets currently operates with liquid hydrogen,
liquid deuterium and gaseous helium 3 or helium 4 as target materials.
A variety of solid targets are also provided; BeO, Carbon and Aluminum
are typical but other self supporting materials are available if need
arises. Carbon targets with holes typically 2 mm in diameter are used
to center the beam.  The combination of cryogenic targets and a few
solid targets is the standard configuration. 

In addition,
there are programs based on polarized $^3$He and polarized
$\textrm{NH}_3$/$\textrm{ND}_3$.
These
are special installations and hence are not available at the same
time as the cryogenic target system.

The target(s) presently in use are discussed in the following sections.
