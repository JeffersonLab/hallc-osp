abstract = "A new version of Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) pulse amplifier, entirely powered by the current flowing through the base voltage divider, was designed and tested. This amplifier was designed for application in the \{JLAB\} \{G0\} Experiment E00-006 as a part of high voltage base for \{XP2262\} Photonis PMT. According to \{JLAB\} \{G0\} experiment requirement, these PMT's operate with plastic scintillators at high counting rate (about MHz). Tests in \{JLAB\} experimental Hall C indicate that low energy gamma background cause up to 0.1 mA of \{PMT\} average anode current (without amplifier). At this radiation condition, \{PMT\} gain decreases by 50% within about 1 month of operation. The amplifier needs to reduce \{PMT\} anode current and to shape \{PMT\} anode pulse prior to sending it through a long cable line (more then 400 ft of RG-213 and RG-58 coax cables). Shaping of the \{PMT\} output pulse helps to reduce attenuation effect of the long cable line without significant reduction of timing accuracy. The results of this study of designed amplifier and \{PMT\} plus amplifier system are presented. "
