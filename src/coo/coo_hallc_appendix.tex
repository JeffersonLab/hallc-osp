\begin{itemize}

\item{
If all other trainings are up-to-date, the \HALL\ walk-through, \AWARENESS, can be arranged 
with {\WALKTHROUGHTRAINER}; 
though during operations those training will only 
happen opportunistically.

\section{Special Procedures for \EXPTS}

Each shift requires a shift leader and, if the cryotarget is cold, a cryotarget 
operator.  A third person on shift is extremely useful, but not required. The shift leader 
has the standard
duties of shift leader to ensure proper data taking, log all activity, and to fill out
the Beam Accounting form. The cryotarget operator should focus on cryotarget
operation. Training is arranged by Greg Smith. The shift leader or third
shift worker will run the DAQ and online analysis codes.
This run period uses the ``standard'' Hall C equipment whose
use and safety procedures are documented in the Hall C Standard Equipment
Manual available from the Hall C web page.

\section{Signature Sheets}

After reading this document, as well as the ESAD, RSAD, and ERG, on-site shift workers must sign
the signature sheet located in the ``yellow binder'' of the experiment specific documents.
This binder can be found in the \HALL\ counting house and in the MCC.

Off-site shift takers must acknowledge to the Physics Division Liaison of the experiment, \PHYSDIVLIAISON\ (\PHYSDIVLIAISONEMAIL),  that they have read and understood the COO, ESAD, RSAD and ERG following the procedure implemented by \HALL\ (e.g. Wikis, email, or other).

{\bf Because (a) on-site and off-site shift takers are subject to different training requirements and (b) the shift-takers signatures are collected and archived for future reference (e.g. to check that shift takers had the required training when on-shift), it is important that the shift taker signs the list corresponding to their shift status (on-site or off-site)}.
