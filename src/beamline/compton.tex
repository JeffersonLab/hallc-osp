\section{Compton Polarimeter}
%\setcounter{subsection}{0}

The Compton Polarimeter provides a continuous, non-destructive measurement of the electron
beam polarization. The system was installed and commissioned in 2010 and has been updated
for use at 11~GeV. The Compton polarimeter is located in the Hall C alcove, just upstream of
the M\o ller Polarimeter (between the 3C19 and 3C20 girders).
