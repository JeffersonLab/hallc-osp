\subsection{High Voltage Supplies}

\subsection{Drift Chambers}

\paragraph{Gas Flow Operating Procedures}
\sawnote{This may be common with enough the HMS that it can be moved
  into common chapter.  Or put common stuff (gas shed) in common
  section and hut details in spectrometer specific sections.}

\paragraph{Electronics Operating Procedures}
\sawnote{Description of drift chamber electronics and turn on procedure.
Threshold, +/-5V, VME crate(s).}

\paragraph{High Voltage Operating Procedures}
\sawnote{Not using CAEN?  What are used, are they remotely
  controlled.}

\subsection{Scintillator and Quartz Hodoscopes}
\sawnote{Should this be combined with HMS or be entirely separate.}
\sawnote{Check that Positive/Negative convention is the same.}
\sawnote{Quartz detector is positive HV.  Big difference from HMS.
  Probably have it's own section separate from HMS.}

\subsection{Noble Gas Cerenkov Detector}
\sawnote{This detector is only sometimes installed}

\subsection{Heavy Gas Cerenkov Detector}
\sawnote{This detector is only sometimes installed}

\subsection{Aerogel Detector}
\sawnote{Need a table of different index of refraction trays}.
The SHMS Aerogel detector is located after the heavy gas cerenkov
detector and before the S2 hodoscope planes.

Characteristics.  Removable Aerogel trays.  Procedure for exchanging
trays.  Provides Kaon, Proton separation. Used in conjunction with the
other detectors serves to identify kaons.

produce Cerenkov light in Aerogel's with various indices of refraction.

\subsection{Lead Glass Shower Calorimeter}

The SHMS lead glass shower calorimeter consists of two section, a
pre-shower layer of 28 TF-1 lead glass 10 cm thick followed by a fly's eye
array of 224 F-101 blocks with a depth of 50 cm.
