\section{The SHMS Detector Package and Shield House }

The Super High Mometum Spectrometer contains two separate shielded
rooms.  The first room, referred to as the electronics hut, contains
electronics associated with the trigger and data acquisition system as
well as magnet power supply controls.
(Figure~\ref{fig:shmshuts})
This room is entered through a concrete
door on the second stairway landing of the spectrometer structure.
The second shielded room, known as the detector hut, is accessed by
passing through the electronics hut.  These rooms are separated a
sliding concrete door.  Both doors must be closed during beam
operations.  The electronics and detector huts have removable ceiling
and wall sections in case detectors or electronics racks need to be
removed or installed.  Walter Kellner, the Hall~C work coordinator,  
must be contacted if the hut walls or ceilings need to be removed.

\subsection{SHMS Electronics and Detector Shield Hut Doors}
\label{sec:shmsdoors}
The SHMS electronics shield hut is accessed through concrete door held
closed by a magnetic lock.  To open this door, press and hold the
button marked OPEN.  (Figure~\ref{fig:shmsdoorcontrol})  This will
deenergize the magnetic lock and rotate
the door.  When the door is open sufficient for access, release the
button.  To close the door, make sure the door is clear of
obstructions and hold the CLOSE button until the door closes and the
magnetic lock activates.  A duplicate set of controls is located on
the inside of this door.

The detector shield hut is accessed by passing through the electronics
hut and passing through a second door.  This door is a sliding door
(``barn door'') and is operated by the lower set of buttons to the
right of that door (Figure~\ref{fig:barndoorcontrol})  If spectrometer
vaccum window has a shutter installed, then this door may only be
opened if that shutter is closed.  This shutter is described in the
next section.

An emergency bypass is available allowing override of the shutter
interlock on the door.  Hearing protection must be worn if detector
hut is accessed while the shutter is open and the spectrometer is
under vacuum.

  buttons control the barn door and the top buttons control the SHMS
  vacuum shutter.  The right picture shows the barn door controls
  located inside the detector hut.}

\subsection{SHMS Vacuum Window Shutter}
\label{sec:shmsshutter}
As described in section~\ref{sec:shmswindows}, there is a large thin
vacuum window at the end of the vacuum pipe in the SHMS detector hut.
Because of
the considerable stored energy in such a large vacuum volume, it is
necessary to protect personnel working in the HMS shield house from
the possibiliity of a catastrophic failure of this vacuum. 
If
the Nobel Gas Cherenkov detector is installed, protection is provided
by that detector.
If the Nobel Gas Cherenkov is not installed, a vacuum
extension pipe, with a window further into the detector hut will be
used.  In this case, the window will be covered by a shutter to
protect personnel working in the SHMS detector hut while the
spectrometer is under vacuum.  This shutter must be in place whenever
the ``barn door'' is open.  The shutter is operated by using the top
set of buttons shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:barndoorcontrol}.  Indicator
lights (not yet installed) show whether the shutter is open or closed.
